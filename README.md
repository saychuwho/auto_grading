## How to use

### Initial setting

1. Install `git`, `zip`, and `unzip`.
```bash
sudo apt install git zip unzip
```
2. Clone this repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/saychuwho/auto_grading.git
```
3. Give permission to shell scripts like this.
```bash
chmod 755 ./sample.sh
chmod 755 ./sample_reset.sh
chmod 755 ./sample_print.sh
```
4. Run `./sample.sh`. 
5. If you want to run `./sample.sh` again, run `./sample_reset.sh` and run `./sample.sh` again.

### Shell scripts function

- `./sample.sh` : Do all grading process.
- `./sample_reset.sh` : Delete all files generated by `./sample.sh`
- `./sample_print.sh` : After executing `./sample.sh`, check results that `./sample.sh` made.
  - how to use: `option student_id [problem_num]`
  - option `1` : print result file. (ex: `1 201911010` prints student id `201911010`'s result file.)
  - option `2` : print student's submitted source code, compiled code, compile result. (ex: `2 201911010 2` prints student id `201911010`'s problem 2 source code, compiled code, compiled result.)
  - optino `3` : print compiled program's case output, `diff` results. (ex: `3 201911010 1` prints student id `201911010`'s problem 2 case output and `diff` results.)

## Features

This program will have these features.

- [x] Unzip student's submission
- [x] Combine student's submission with grading codes
- [x] Compile and execute grading codes
- [ ] Analyze outputs of grading code and score codes.

### Unzip student's submission

Unzip student's submission in `./student_submission`. If there are no zip file, student id will not be in `sample_student_list_submitted.txt"

### Combine student's submission with grading codes

Combine student's submission with `.cpp` files inside `./grading_cases` by problem number and cases.

### Compile and execute grading codes

Compile `.cpp` inside `./outputs/sample_{student_id}` and make `*_output.txt`, `*_compile_result.txt`. `*_output_diff.txt`.

### Analyze outputs of grading code and score codes

Analyze `*_output.txt`, `*_compile_result.txt`. `*_output_diff.txt` inside `./outputs/sample_{student_id}` and make result files. 

Result files should be remake into `.csv` that contains scores with python script.

Proper problem cases should be in `./grading_cases`.
