## How to use

### Initial setting

1. Install `git`, `zip`, and `unzip`.
```bash
sudo apt install git zip unzip
```
2. Clone this repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/saychuwho/auto_grading.git
```
3. Give permission to shell scripts like this.
```bash
chmod 755 ./sample.sh
chmod 755 ./sample_reset.sh
chmod 755 ./sample_print.sh
```
4. Run `./sample.sh`. 
5. If you want to run `./sample.sh` again, run `./sample_reset.sh` and run `./sample.sh` again.

### Required files

- `sample_student_list.txt`: student id list
- `sample_hw_info.txt`: Assignment information
  - First line: Name of assignment
  - Second line: Number of problems(n) in assignment
  - Third line ~ (n+3) line: Problem name
  - (n+4) line ~ : Problems's test case number
- `sample_hw_info_score.txt`: Assignment score information
  - Each line contains n-th problems m-th case's score.
  - n is smaller than "number of problem in assignment"
  - m is smaller than "number of cases in problem"
- Inside `./grading_cases/`, you MUST need two files.
  1. Problem-case grading "main.cpp" file.
  2. Case answer output file.

### Scripts Explanation

- `./sample.sh` : Do all grading process.
- `./sample_reset.sh` : Delete all files generated by `./sample.sh`
- `./sample_print.sh` : After executing `./sample.sh`, check results that `./sample.sh` made.
  - Usage: `./sample_print.sh student_id`. Input `student_id`, and It will make markdown report file.
  - `./sample_print.sh` will automatically run by `./sample.sh`, so you don't need to run.
- `./sample_grade.py` : Combine all result files into one `.csv`. Future work will calculate all scores.
  
  
### case of scores
- `zip-file-not-submitted` : Student did not submitted `.zip` file
- `file-not-submitted` : Student submitted `.zip` file, but inside `.zip` file, there are no source code
- `compile-error` : Student submitted source code, but case code failed to compile
- `fail` : Student's code is compiled and ran, but output did not match with answer output
- `pass` : Student's code passed case. 

## Features

This program will have these features.

- [x] Unzip student's submission
- [x] Combine student's submission with grading codes
- [x] Compile and execute grading codes
- [ ] Analyze outputs of grading code and score codes.

### Unzip student's submission

Unzip student's submission in `./student_submission`. If there are no zip file, student id will not be in `sample_student_list_submitted.txt"

### Combine student's submission with grading codes

Combine student's submission with `.cpp` files inside `./grading_cases` by problem number and cases.

### Compile and execute grading codes

Compile `.cpp` inside `./outputs/sample_{student_id}` and make `*_output.txt`, `*_compile_result.txt`. `*_output_diff.txt`.

### Analyze outputs of grading code and score codes

Analyze `*_output.txt`, `*_compile_result.txt`. `*_output_diff.txt` inside `./outputs/sample_{student_id}` and make result files. 

Result files content combined in `./sample_result.csv`.

Proper problem cases should be in `./grading_cases`.

## Update List

- 2024.09.04 : Re-design `sample.sh`, `sample_print.sh`. Add `sample_guide.py`
- 2024.09.02 : initial commit. Updated sample program
